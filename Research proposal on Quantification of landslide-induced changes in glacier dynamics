The interaction between glaciers and landslides, as well as the associated risks they pose, have gained significant attention in the context of global climate change. This proposal aims to address key aspects related to landslides occurring on ice surfaces, with the objective of advancing our understanding of glacier dynamics and the hazards they present. By conducting an extensive review of small chunk of existing literature, this proposal sheds some light on the potential risks posed by paraglacial landslides triggered by intense rainstorms and heightened pore-water pressure. The primary focus of this proposal is on landslides occurring on ice surfaces. To achieve this, a methodology is proposed that integrates remote sensing techniques (such as satellite imagery and LiDAR) with ground surveying methods (including field surveys and in situ measurements) to gain a better understanding of various aspects of glacier dynamics, such as extent, speed, thickness, and flow rate and Digital Elevation Model. It is acknowledged that there may be challenges related to accessing remote areas, data availability, and the need for specialized expertise and equipment. To overcome these challenges, collaboration with local institutions, capacity-building programs, and the utilization of advanced technologies are recommended. This proposal has the potential to contribute to our comprehension of glacier dynamics, facilitate the development of effective mitigation strategies, and support the management of hazards associated with glaciers. Ultimately, it aims to safeguard human lives and critical infrastructure by mitigating the devastating impacts of landslides on ice surfaces.
