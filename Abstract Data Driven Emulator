The research proposal aims to develop a data-driven emulator for predicting freshwater influx in the Arctic region. The Arctic has been experiencing significant changes in sea ice concentration, sea surface temperature, air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and salinity, which have implications for freshwater influx and its impact on the environment, climate, and ecosystems. To address this challenge, the proposed research will utilize machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression, to analyze historical data and make accurate predictions for future freshwater influx patterns. The outcomes of this research have the potential to contribute to a deeper understanding of Arctic environmental changes and offer valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in developing targeted strategies to address the challenges faced by the Arctic region. By combining the power of data-driven modeling with machine learning, this research presents a promising approach to studying and predicting freshwater influx in the Arctic.
