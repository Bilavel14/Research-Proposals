The research project focuses on understanding the impact of climate change on soil temperature in the Great Hungarian Plain, a critical agricultural area in southeastern Hungary. By employing advanced technologies such as remote sensing and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, this study aims to address the gap in knowledge regarding soil temperature dynamics and its implications for agriculture. The objectives include analysing historical trends, utilizing real-time monitoring, predicting future changes, and engaging with local stakeholders to develop tailored adaptation strategies. The expected outcomes are a detailed dataset, predictive models, and practical recommendations to support sustainable agricultural practices and enhance resilience in the region.
